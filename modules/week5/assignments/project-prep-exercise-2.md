# Project Prep Exercise 2

## Statement of Purpose and Scope For My Project

### What is the purpose of your site?
To be able to have a personal portfolio/resume website, it would show
accomplishments and career related information. I eventually will move the website to run on my personal servers with my braydencorbridge.com domain name to make it more connected to me.

### Who is the target audience?
My target is mostly recruiters/hiring teams but I also want to design it in a way that is
personalized for anyone to see and understand me as a person.

### How can I tailor the site to reach that audience?
I can make it very easy to see right away my qualifications for a job. I am debating on putting my resume on the home page or if I want to have a dedicated page for that.

### What are the goals for the site?
Like previously said I want to show off my resume and career related information. I also want to show personal projects to show my personal side.

### How will I gather the information?
I will mostly be using my resume as reference to my career history and skills.

### What are my sources for media content?
I will mostly be using pictures of myself, and project pictures.

### What is my budget?
This won't cost me anything.

### What is my timeline?
I would like to have something presentable before the end of the semseter.

### Who is my project team?
I am working on this project myself

### How often should the site be updated?
Anytime there is a need to change my resume information or update my skills

### Who will update the site?
I will be updating it myself.
